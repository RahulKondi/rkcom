The website shall contain these distinctly:
### Landing Page
Contains : Photograph, name, brief
### Personal blog/feed

### Portfolio
Will have a list of projects. Each Project has its own page. 
-S: should each project have a blog of sorts for a feed/updates?
-K: no, i'll keep updating the same project page evertime there's something new. Also, remember, project-pages aren't blogposts, per se. they're actually individual html pages
